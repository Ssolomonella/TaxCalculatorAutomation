## Tax Calculator API UI- Test Progress Report

Test Execution Summary:

The Tax Calculator API has undergone thorough testing, with a total of 32 test cases executed across different components. All tests were executed successfully, and no defects were found during the test execution phase.

Here's the breakdown:

API UI Component:

Total Test Cases: 32

Passed: 32

Failed: 0

Button Component:

Total Test Cases: 9

Passed: 9

Failed: 0

Summary Area Component:

Total Test Cases: 8

Passed: 8

Failed: 0

Input Field Component:

Total Test Cases: 8

Passed: 8

Failed: 0

Alert Message Component:

Total Test Cases: 7

Passed: 7

Failed: 0

Test Case Pass Percentage:

API UI Component: 100% (32/32 x 100)

Button Component: 100% (9/9 x 100)

Summary Area Component: 100% (8/8 x 100)

Input Field Component: 100% (8/8 x 100)

Alert Message Component: 100% (7/7 x 100)

Conclusion:

The test execution for the Tax Calculator API has been comprehensive and successful. All the executed test cases for the API UI, Button Component, Summary Area Component, Input Field Component, and Alert Message Component have passed, resulting in a 100% pass rate across the board. The testing phase ensures that the system is functioning as expected, and the Tax Calculator API is ready for deployment.





## Test Progress Report for Tax Calculator API  â€“ SH Team

1. Executive Summary

This report provides a summary of the testing activities and results for the Tax Calculator API. During the reporting period, we executed 27 test cases focusing on three endpoints: Retrieval of Tax Brackets, Finding Tax Brackets, and Tax Calculation.

Overall, the API demonstrated a high degree of conformance with the specifications, with all but one of the test cases passing. This indicates that the API is mostly working as expected and users are likely to have a positive experience.

2. Test Execution Summary

Out of the 27 test cases executed, 26 passed, and 1 failed. The details are as follows:

Retrieval of Tax Brackets: 1/1 passed

Finding Tax Brackets: 7/8 passed, 1 failed

Tax Calculation: 18/18 passed

3. Defects

We found one defect during the test execution in the Finding Tax Brackets functionality:

Negative Numerical Input Accepted by the Find Tax Bracket Endpoints

Defect Description: Negative numerical input accepted by the Find Tax Bracket endpoint

Status: Unresolved

This defect allows users to input negative numbers which is not a valid scenario for tax bracket calculation.

4. Progress Indicators









Total test cases planned: 27

Total test cases executed: 27

Total test cases passed: 26

Total test cases failed: 1

Defects opened: 1

Defects resolved: 1

5. Conclusions and Recommendations

The overall quality of the Tax Calculator API is high, with a pass rate of 96.4%. However, there is one defect that needs to be addressed to ensure that users cannot input negative numbers for tax calculation.

Our recommendation is to focus efforts on resolving this defect before final release. Once this defect has been resolved, we will need to re-run the test cases to confirm that the issue has been adequately addressed.

We look forward to your feedback on this report and any further directions you might have for our testing efforts.



Addendum:

The defect has now been resolved and the Tax Calculator API has now a 100% pass rate.
